# Rule Engine Application

## Overview
This project implements a Rule Engine Application designed to evaluate user eligibility based on attributes such as age, department, salary, and experience. The application utilizes an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for representing rules and allows for dynamic modification and evaluation.

## Features
- **Dynamic Rule Insertion**: Users can insert rules and values at runtime.
- **Rule Evaluation**: The engine evaluates user attributes against defined rules.
- **Logical Operators**: Supports complex rules using AND/OR operators.
- **Database Integration**: Rules can be stored and retrieved from a JDBC-compatible database.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Programming language used for development.
- **NetBeans IDE**: Development environment used for coding and testing.
- **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**: For rule representation and evaluation.
- **JDBC**: For database connectivity.
  **SQL**: For database.
