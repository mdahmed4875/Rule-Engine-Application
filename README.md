<h1>Rule Engine Application</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This project is a Rule Engine Application built in Java. It allows users to define and evaluate rules based on user attributes like age, department, salary, and experience. The rules are represented using Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) and stored in a database for persistence. The application dynamically modifies and evaluates the rules to determine user eligibility or conditions.</p>
